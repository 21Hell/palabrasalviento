c - Did not...couldn't get into it.
-Explay yourself
c - It insists upon itself.

Well, what can I say? I was told that this was the greatest horror film ever and I was very disappointed. I wanted to like the movie, but the horror was ruined by so much pop culture. I mean, if I had watched the film earlier, I might have had a different opinion of it and maybe enjoyed it more.

The acting and the performances were good, but the psychological horror of a man trying to kill his wife was just sickening to me, not terrifying. I felt sorry for Wendy and her son Danny, but this movie’s connection to another film about a kid who has a sixth sense is overshadowed by that superior movie: The Sixth Sense.
