      I care, I care a little to much
      No, that's wrong
      People care to little
      They expect the same
      And that's what leaves me beaten

      For me to not care that's the hard part
      Â¿How could you not care?
      If you cared a little

      I swear it won't tear you apart
      Please, I implore to you
      Care for everyone else
      i can not expect for you to care for me
      you probably have to much to care about

      Take care, that's all
